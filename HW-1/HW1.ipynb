    "### Local installation\n",
    "The alternative is to have a local installation, although we do not recommend it. If you are working on Google Colab, feel free to skip to the next section \"More instructions\". We recommend using virtual environments for all your installations. Following is one way to set up a working environment on your local machine for this assignment, using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/): \n",
    "\n",
    "- Download and install Anaconda following the instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)\n",
    "- Create a conda environment using `conda create --name dl_env python=3` (You can change the name of the environment instead of calling it `dl_env`)\n",
    "- Now activate the environment using : `conda activate dl_env`\n",
    "- Install jupyter lab, which is the [jupyter project's](https://jupyter.org/index.html) latest notebook interface : `pip install jupyterlab`. You can also use the classic jupyter notebooks and there isn't any difference except the interface.\n",
    "- Install other necessary libraries. For this assignment you need `numpy`, `scipy` , [`pytorch`](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and `matplotlib`, all of which can be installed using : `pip install <lib_name>`. Doing this in the environment, would install these libraries for `dl_env`. You can also use `conda install`.\n",
    "- Now download the assignment notebook in a local directory and launching `jupyter lab` in the same directory should open a jupyter lab session in your default browser, where you can open and edit the ipython notebook.\n",
    "- For deactivating the environment when you are done with it, use : `conda deactivate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For users running a Jupyter server on a remote machine :\n",
    "- Launch Jupyter lab on the remote server (in the directory with the homework ipynb file) using : `jupyter lab --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0`\n",
    "- To access the jupyter lab interface on your local browser, you need to set up ssh port forwarding. This can be done by running : `ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 <remoteuser>@<remotehost>`. You can now open `localhost:8888` on your local browser to access jupyter lab. This assumes you are running jupyter lab on its default port 8888 on the server.\n",
    "- Check \"Making life easy\" section at the end of [this post](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/01/31/running-a-jupyter-notebook/) to find how to add functions to your bash run config to do this more easily each time. The post mentions functions for jupyter notebook, but just replace those with jupyter lab if you are using that interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above instructions specify one way of working on the assignment. You can use other virtual environments/ipython notebook interfaces etc. (**not recommended**)."
